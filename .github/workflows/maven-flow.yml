# Continuous Integration Workflow for the Openjpa Project
#
# This workflow automates the build and test process using Apache Maven.
# It is configured to execute on every push and pull request targeting the 'master' branch.
# The primary job consists of setting up the build environment, compiling the source code,
# executing unit tests via the Surefire plugin, and archiving the resulting test reports.
